DESCRIPTION
       This module retrieves the 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15
       minute load average of a machine.

SYNOPSIS
        use Sys::CpuLoad;
        print '1 min, 5 min, 15 min load average: ',
              join(',', Sys::CpuLoad::load()), "\n";


TO-DO
       - Better getloadavg() support.  Currently FreeBSD and OpenBSD
         are supported.  To improve upon this, see the next item below.
       - Instead of hard coding preprocessor macros around getloadavg(),
         try to compile C code snippets to see if getloadavg() is supported.
       - Wanted: HPUX 11.11 pstat_getprocessor() and
                 HPUX 11.00 pstat(PSTAT_PROCESSOR, ...)
                 man pages, sample code, and preprocessor macros.
       - Win32 support
