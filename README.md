# DESCRIPTION

This module retrieves the 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute load average

# EXPORTS

## load

This method returns the load average for 1 minute, 5 minutes and 15
minutes as an array.

On Linux systems it will attempt to use `/proc/loadavg`.

On FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems, it will make a call to `getloadavg`.

Otherwise, it will attempt to parse the output of `uptime`.

On error, it will return an array of `undef` values.
